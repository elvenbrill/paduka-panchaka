The mind there contemplates the two lotuses which are the feet of the Guru, and
of which the ruby-coloured nectar is the honey. These two feet are cool like the
nectar of the Moon, and are the place of all auspiciousness.

## Commentary by Śrī-Kālīcaraṇa

Having described the place where the two lotus feet of the Guru should be
meditated upon, he now speaks of the (_sādhaka_’s) union therewith by meditation
(_dhyāna_) on them, in this and the following verse.

“There” (_tatra_)—i.e., in the triangle on the Maṇi-pīṭha. The meaning of this
verse, in short, is: “The mind there, within the triangle on the Maṇi-pīṭha,
contemplates upon the lotus feet of the Guru.”

“Of which the ruby-coloured nectar is the honey” (_kuṅkumāsava-parīmarandayoḥ_).
This qualifies “the lotuses”. _Kuṅkuma_ means red, the colour of lac. The
excellent nectar which is of the colour of lac is the honey of the lotus feet of
the Guru. Some read “_jharī_” for “_parī_”; the meaning would then be: “from
which flows like honey the rubycoloured nectar.”

“Cool like the nectar of the Moon” (_indu-makaranda-śītalaṃ_)—i.e., they are
cool as the nectar-like beams of the Moon. As the beams of the Moon counteract
heat, so does devotion to the feet of the Guru overcome sorrow and suffering.

“Place of all auspiciousness” (_maṅgalāspadam_). It is the place where one gets
all one desires. The sense is that by devout concentration on the feet of the
Guru all success is attained.
