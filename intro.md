**Note**: _The meaning of this is explained in v.7, post. This verse is inserted
as it was found in a manuscript belonging to the late Acalānanda-Svāmī, now in
the possession of the Varendra Anusaṃdhāna Samiti_.

I meditate on the Guru in the Lotus of a thousand petals, which is radiant like
the cool rays of the full moon, whose lotus hands make the gestures which grant
blessing and dispel fear. His raiment, garland, and perfumes, are ever fresh and
pure. His countenance is benign. He is in the Haṃsa in the head. He is the Haṃsa
Himself.
